                <p class="mb-4">
                    I found myself repeatedly copying and pasting individual
                    keys and values from .env files when deploying applications
                    and became frustrated with this.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    I like the experience of using Vercel, where you can copy an
                    entire .env file this tool to seperate keys and values from
                    .env file and let me copy them easily is a way for me
                    slightly improve my experience until the platforms I use
                    implement a similar feature.

                    Isn't this extremely unsafe?
                </h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Yes, it is unsafe. I made this site for my personal use and
                    while I use this even with my sensitive information, I
                    wouldn't recommend others to do so. But since this is just a
                    HTML file with a bit of JavaScript, you can see the code
                    yourself and run it locally if you want to.
